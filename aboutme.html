                <p>I'm a totally great programmer! My main project that I am working on is called color my cat. It is my passion in life to color in pictures of cats. This is the very reason that I am working on my main project which
                    I'm sure will be a billion-dollar idea. I've already gotten over a million dollars in investments! When I'm not coloring in cats, I enjoy other activities such as ant ranching. I have 4 ant colonies that I am currently
                    taking care of. It used to be 10, but my colonies keep dying off.  I like to view my failures as times of learning.
